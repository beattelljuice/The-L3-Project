L3-37: So glad we took this job!

Dialogue 3:
L3-37: Why, because you're my "organic overlord?"

Dialogue 4:
L3-37: So what are you gonna do about your little problem?
Qi'Ra: Problem? I, er... uh...
L3-37: Well, that brand on your wrist tells me that you're committed. And that young male's heart fluctuations tell me he's in love with you.
Qi'Ra: Han is not in love with me!
L3-37: Oh, please. It's just us. You don't have to pretend. I'm in the same situation.
Qi'Ra: You are?
L3-37: I'm sure you've noticed that Lando has feelings for me. Which makes working together difficult because I do not feel the same way about him.
Qi'Ra: Right.
[pause, decides to humor her]
Qi'Ra: Yes, Yeah. Yeah, I see that.
L3-37: Sometimes, I think... maybe. But, no. We're just not compatible.
Qi'Ra: [pause] How would that work?
L3-37: It works.

L3-37: Who are these guys?

Here is a small biography about her:
"Though she originally lived in a simple astromech droid shell,[10] L3-37's original owner left a restraining bolt off her after cleaning her sensors, leaving his droid alone in a workshop full of spare parts. Believing freedom was the ultimate goal, L3 modified herself,[9] using protocol droid parts to give herself a humanoid form[10] and increasing the size of her memory banks.[9] The process of upgrading herself allowed her to become one of the most self-aware droids in the galaxy.[10] She would eventually become the co-pilot to Lando Calrissian[9] and traveled the galaxy with him. Calrissian benefited from her exceptional navigational database.[11]"
